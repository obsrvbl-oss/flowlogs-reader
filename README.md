Amazon's VPC Flow Logs are analogous to NetFlow and IPFIX logs, and can be used for security and performance analysis.
[Observable Networks](https://observable.net) uses VPC Flow logs as an input to endpoint modeling for security monitoring.

This project contains:
* A utility for working with VPC Flow Logs on the command line
* A Python library for retrieving and working with VPC Flow logs

The tools support reading Flow Logs from both [CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs-cwl.html) and [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs-s3.html).
For S3 destinations, [version 3](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/learn-from-your-vpc-flow-logs-with-additional-meta-data/) custom log formats are supported.

The library builds on [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) and should work on the [supported versions](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches) of Python 3.

For information on VPC Flow Logs and how to enable them see [this post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/vpc-flow-logs-log-and-view-network-traffic-flows/) at the AWS blog.
You may use this library with the [kinesis-logs-reader](https://github.com/obsrvbl/kinesis-logs-reader) library when retrieving VPC flow logs from Amazon Kinesis.


## Installation

You can get `flowlogs_reader` by using `pip`:

```
pip install flowlogs_reader
```

Or if you want to install from source and/or contribute you can clone from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/obsrvbl/flowlogs-reader.git
cd flowlogs-reader
python setup.py develop
```

## CLI Usage

`flowlogs-reader` provides a command line interface called `flowlogs_reader` that allows you to print VPC Flow Log records to your screen.
It assumes your AWS credentials are available through environment variables, a boto configuration file, or through IAM metadata.
Some example uses are below.

__Location types__

`flowlogs_reader` has one required argument, `location`. By default that is interpreted as a CloudWatch Logs group.

To use an S3 location, specify `--location-type='s3'`:

* `flowlogs_reader --location-type="s3" "bucket-name/optional-prefix"`

__Printing flows__

The default action is to `print` flows. You may also specify the `ipset`, `findip`, and `aggregate` actions:

* `flowlogs_reader location` - print all flows in the past hour
* `flowlogs_reader location print 10` - print the first 10 flows from the past hour
* `flowlogs_reader location ipset` - print the unique IPs seen in the past hour
* `flowlogs_reader location findip 198.51.100.2` - print all flows involving 198.51.100.2
* `flowlogs_reader location aggregate` - aggregate the flows by 5-tuple, then print them as a tab-separated stream (with a header). This requires that each of the fields in the 5-tuple are present in the data format.

You may combine the output of `flowlogs_reader` with other command line utilities:

* `flowlogs_reader location | grep REJECT` - print all `REJECT`ed Flow Log records
* `flowlogs_reader location | awk '$6 = 443'` - print all traffic from port 443

__Time windows__

The default time window is the last hour. You may also specify a `--start-time` and/or an `--end-time`. The `-s` and `-e` switches may be used also:

* `flowlogs_reader --start-time='2015-08-13 00:00:00' location`
* `flowlogs_reader --end-time='2015-08-14 00:00:00' location`
* `flowlogs_reader --start-time='2015-08-13 01:00:00' --end-time='2015-08-14 02:00:00' location`

Use the `--time-format` switch to control how start and end times are interpreted. The default is `'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`. See the Python documentation for `strptime` for information on format strings.

__Concurrent reads__

Give `--thread-count` to read from multiple log groups or S3 keys at once:

* `flowlogs_reader --thread_count=4 location`

__AWS options__

Other command line switches:

* `flowlogs_reader --region='us-west-2' location` - connect to the given AWS region
* `flowlogs_reader --profile='dev_profile' location` - use the profile from your [local AWS configuration file](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html) to specify credentials and regions
* `flowlogs_reader --role-arn='arn:aws:iam::12345678901:role/myrole' --external-id='0a1b2c3d' location` - use the given role and external ID to connect to a 3rd party's account using [`sts assume-role`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/assume-role.html)

For CloudWatch Logs locations:

* `flowlogs_reader --filter-pattern='REJECT' location` - use the given [filter pattern](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html) to have the server limit the output

For S3 locations:

* `flowlogs_reader --location-type='s3' --include-accounts='12345678901,12345678902' bucket-name/optional-prefix` - return logs only for the given accounts
* `flowlogs_reader --location-type='s3' --include-regions='us-east-1,us-east-2' bucket-name/optional-prefix` - return logs only for the given regions


## Module Usage

`FlowRecord` takes an `event` dictionary retrieved from a log stream. It parses the `message` in the event, which takes a record like this:

```
2 123456789010 eni-102010ab 198.51.100.1 192.0.2.1 443 49152 6 10 840 1439387263 1439387264 ACCEPT OK
```

And turns it into a Python object like this:

```python
>>> flow_record.srcaddr
'198.51.100.1'
>>> flow_record.dstaddr
'192.0.2.1'
>>> flow_record.srcport
443
>>> flow_record.to_dict()
{'account_id': '123456789010',
 'action': 'ACCEPT',
 'bytes': 840,
 'dstaddr': '192.0.2.1',
 'dstport': 49152,
 'end': datetime.datetime(2015, 8, 12, 13, 47, 44),
 'interface_id': 'eni-102010ab',
 'log_status': 'OK',
 'packets': 10,
 'protocol': 6,
 'srcaddr': '198.51.100.1',
 'srcport': 443,
 'start': datetime.datetime(2015, 8, 12, 13, 47, 43),
 'version': 2}
```

`FlowLogsReader` reads from CloudWatch Logs. It takes the name of a log group and can then yield all the Flow Log records from that group.

```python
>>> from flowlogs_reader import FlowLogsReader
... flow_log_reader = FlowLogsReader('flowlog_group')
... records = list(flow_log_reader)
... print(len(records))
176
```

`S3FlowLogsReader` reads from S3. It takes a `bucket` name or a `bucket/prefix` identifier.

By default these classes will yield records from the last hour.

You can control what's retrieved with these parameters:
* `start_time` and `end_time` are Python `datetime.datetime` objects
* `region_name` is a string like `'us-east-1'`.
* `boto_client` is a boto3 client object.

When using `FlowLogsReader` with CloudWatch Logs:

* The `filter_pattern` keyword is a string like `REJECT` or `443` used to filter the logs. See the examples below.

When using `S3FlowLogsReader` with S3:

* The `include_accounts` keyword is an iterable of account identifiers (as strings) used to filter the logs.
* The `include_regions` keyword is an iterable of region names used to filter the logs.

## Examples

Start by importing `FlowLogsReader`:

```python
from flowlogs_reader import FlowLogsReader
```

Find all of the IP addresses communicating inside the VPC:

```python
ip_set = set()
for record in FlowLogsReader('flowlog_group'):
    ip_set.add(record.srcaddr)
    ip_set.add(record.dstaddr)
```

See all of the traffic for one IP address:

```python
target_ip = '192.0.2.1'
records = []
for record in FlowLogsReader('flowlog_group'):
    if (record.srcaddr == target_ip) or (record.dstaddr == target_ip):
        records.append(record)
```

Loop through a few preconfigured profiles and collect all of the IP addresses:

```python
ip_set = set()
profile_names = ['profile1', 'profile2']
for profile_name in profile_names:
    for record in FlowLogsReader('flowlog_group', profile_name=profile_name):
        ip_set.add(record.srcaddr)
        ip_set.add(record.dstaddr)
```

Apply a filter for UDP traffic that was logged normally (CloudWatch Logs only):

```python
FILTER_PATTERN = (
    '[version="2", account_id, interface_id, srcaddr, dstaddr, '
    'srcport, dstport, protocol="17", packets, bytes, '
    'start, end, action, log_status="OK"]'
)

flow_log_reader = FlowLogsReader('flowlog_group', filter_pattern=FILTER_PATTERN)
records = list(flow_log_reader)
print(len(records))
```

Retrieve logs from a list of regions:

```python
from flowlogs_reader import S3FlowLogsReader

reader = S3FlowLogsReader('example-bucket/optional-prefix', include_regions=['us-east-1', 'us-east-2'])
records = list(reader)
print(len(records))
```

You may aggregate records with the `aggregate_records` function.
Pass in a `FlowLogsReader` or `S3FlowLogsReader` object and optionally a `key_fields` tuple.
Python `dict` objects will be yielded representing the aggregated flow records.
By default the typical `('srcaddr', 'dstaddr', 'srcport', 'dstport', 'protocol')` will be used.
The `start`, `end`, `packets`, and `bytes` items will be aggregated.

```python
flow_log_reader = FlowLogsReader('flowlog_group')
key_fields = ('srcaddr', 'dstaddr')
records = list(aggregated_records(flow_log_reader, key_fields=key_fields))
```
